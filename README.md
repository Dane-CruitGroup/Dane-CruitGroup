<h1>About me</h1>
<p>As I have started to compile different bios around all corners of the internet I have tried making them all a little different. I was born and raised in Tampa, Florida and have owned that since before people wanted to move here. If you came here from my
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dane-lynch-59363973/">Linkedin</a> you already know I owned a UPS store in the past. That was a lot of fun but I was glad to move onto something else. I really enjoy trying to find people jobs for companies they want to work for and where they will also feel valued.
 I have interviewed people in my previous company and have looked at thousands of resumes while recruiting and I feel I have a good barometer of what companies are looking for. So if you have any questions throughout your hiring process ask me, whether i'm working with you or not. When I'm not sourcing candidates for roles i'm usually watching youtube videos, cooking or researching what green tech item I want installed in my house.
This is my first iteration of this Github bio so I will be sure to update it as I learn new skills and connect with better developers.<br>
